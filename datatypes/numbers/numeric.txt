Numbers / neumaric are another data type in python
This datatype is are devided into 
           1. intiger   - example: 1, 3, 4, 7, 10, 99
           2. float     - example: 1.2, 3.9, 2.5, 8.4,9.1 
You can perform arithmetic operations like addition, multiplication, subs, division.
this dataype also have some inbuilt fuctions like abs() round() and math

important built in fuctions    
            
             1. abs(x)                  - used to convert negative value into positive 
             2. round(x , n)            - Round x into n decimal places
             3. max(iterable)           - print largest Numbers
             4. min(iterable)           - print smallest number 
             5. sum(iterable , start=0) - prints the sum of an interable 
             6. int(x)                  - converts into number
             7. float(x)                - converts iterable into float
             8. complex(x,y)           - complex(2,3)--->(2+3j)
